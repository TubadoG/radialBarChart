This is a radial variant of my earlier example [stacked bar chart](/mbostock/3886208). While pretty, you probably *don’t* want to use this version because it’s easier to compare the bars when they share an aligned (linear) axis. You might consider this form if your ordinal axis is cyclical, such as weeks of the year, and you want to show a cyclical pattern. This example’s data is not cyclical, so the use of a radial form here is rather gratuitous!
